<p><font color="#0000EE">Sir Charles Bell was one of three sons of a minister of the Church of
England who died when Charles was five. The personality and career of Charles
Bell thus reflect the influence of his mother. Widowed, she assumed the
responsibilities of rearing and educating her four sons. She was a remarkable
woman, intelligent and artistic, who instilled in her sons high ideals,
ambition, cultural interests, and a devotion that bordered on reverence.
It is not surprising then that Charles was a sensitive and aesthetic person
and an accomplished artist.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Charles Bell was the younger brother of John Bell (1763-1820), who was
to become a well known surgeon, famous as a teacher, author, and the owner
of a well appointed library.&nbsp;
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Charles Bell was also tutored in art and attended Edinburgh High School
for three years. Spurred by the example of his elder brother, he commenced
studying medicine at Edinburgh, attending John's anatomical lectures and
together developing their artistic talent which they shared. While still
a student under the guidance of his brother, he taught anatomy and published
"A system of dissection explaining the anatomy of the human body, etc."
- a work on anatomy containing extraordinary illustrations of his own.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1799 Charles Bell graduated at the university of Edinburgh, and was
admitted to the Royal College of Surgeons. At the surgical operations he
carried out at the Royal infirmary, he proved himself as able in surgery
as in anatomy. The patient had no say. He also concerned himself with the
production of wax preparations.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1802 and 1802 the volumes 3 and 4 of "Anatomy of the human body",
appeared. In this joint publication of John and Charles Bell, Charles prepared
the parts on the nerves, the sensory organs, and the viscera.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">The success of John Bell's anatomy classes aroused the jealousy of the
members of the Faculty of medicine at the University of Edinburgh, who
succeeded in barring him and Charles from practice at the Royal Infirmary
or positions at the University.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1804, his career in Edinburgh blocked, Charles Bell went to London
to make his own fortune. In his baggage he had the manuscript for the first
book of his own, "Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting" (1806),
the first textbook of anatomy for painters. Besides being an exposition
of the anatomical and physiological basis of facial expression for artists,
the book included much philosophy and critical history of art.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1809, following the retreat from La Coruna, the wounded were brought
to London, where Charles Bell cared for the wounded from Coruna and had
ample opportunity to prove his skills as an operator. Bell had opened a
private school of anatomy, and in 1812 took over the Great Windmill Street
School of Anatomy, founded by William Hunter (1718-1783) and made famous
by him and his brother, John Hunter (1728-1793). Here he proved himself
an excellent teacher while continuing his research on the anatomy and function
of the nerves. He ran the hospital until 1825.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1814 he accepted a position as surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital
and was instrumental in the founding of the Middlesex Hospital and Medical
School in London in 1828.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">At the battle of Waterloo (June 18, 1815), Bell operated on the wounded
until "his clothes were stiff with blood and his arms powerless with the
exertion of using the knife". It was at Waterloo he produced the oil paintings
and etchings of gunshot wounds now on display in the custody of the Royal
College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. About a soldier Bell painted, but did
not operate upon himself, he wrote: "The ball struck the head of the humerus,
and shattered it, passed through and wounded a rib. It was resolved to
amputate at the shoulder joint. It was reported to me that the patient
sunk from loss of blood. I thought myself entitled to say that the method
followed by our army surgeons was too bold, and not suited to common practice,
and especially in a case like this, when the patient was reduced by a complication
in the wound."
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Bell's most important works are in the fields of research on the brain
and the nerves. His book An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain (1811) has
been called the "Magna Carta of neurology." It was first published in private
printing &#8211; he only circulated one hundred copies to his acquaintances &#8211;
then published nothing more on the subject for ten years.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In the book he discusses the functions of the brain and the cerebellum,
he describes the double roots of the spinal nerves and how he, as the first
ever, experimentally investigated their different functions on a living
animal - a donkey. Bell found that an irritation of the ventral roots caused
cramps, while a disturbance of the dorsal roots produced no visible symptoms.
He assumed that the ventral roots connected the peripherous nervous system
with the cerebrum, which was the centre of sensibility and motility, while
the dorsal roots connected the periphery to the cerebellum, the centre
of the vegetative functions of the body.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">It is doubtful if Bell recognized the significance of his finding at
the time, since he still held that all nerves were sensory, classifying
them as sensible and insensible.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In the early 1820s, Francois Magendie in Bordeaux, who had heard of
Bell's work from John Shaw, Bell's assistant at the Great Windmill School,
demonstrated that the ventral roots of spinal nerves are motor, the dorsal
roots are sensory. Bell had missed the latter fact, as he, because of his
dislike of vivisection, as he always stunned the animals with a blow to
the head. A conflict of priority arose, but the scientists reached an agreement,
and the rule of the function of the spinal nerves was called Bell-Magendie's
law. This distinction of the nervous traffic is considered the first important
step towards an investigation of the activity of the nerves, becoming the
starting point for Charles Sherrington's epoch-making works.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">Charles Bell was even higher recognized abroad than at home, but in
1824 he became the first professor of anatomy and surgery of the College
of Surgeons in London, where he was well known for his well prepared and
elegant lectures. In 1928, at the opening of the University of London,
the private Great Windmill Street school became a part of King's College,
on which occasion Bell was called upon as professor of physiology at the
University of London. However, he was not satisfied with the conditions
at the university, resigned his position and had to make a living from
practicing, which de did not like.
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In 1826 he published a second edition of his then dead brother's "Principles
of surgery". He was a kindly man and somewhat a dandy in dress. In 1829
Bell received the first medal awarded by the Royal Society &#8211; 50 Guineas;
he was knighted by King William IV (1765-1837) in 1831. Despite the honours
bestowed upon him, in 1835 he accepted an invitation to become professor
of surgery in Edinburgh, and in 1836 left London, because "London was good
place to live in but not to die in". He was by then 62 years of age, but
continued his activities as intensively. Another reason for his return
was his love of flyfishing!
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">In England he was considered the foremost physician and scientist of
his day. At a visit in Paris professor Roux concluded a lecture in his
honour with the words "C'est assez, Messieurs, vous avez vu Charles Bell".
</font>
</p><p><font color="#0000EE">There was a captivating twinkle behind his eyeglasses, and he was genial
and unaffected. Renowned physicians from all over came to visit him in
London, and his travels abroad became triumphant processions. He received
many honours including knighthood, conferred by the enthusiast Lord Henry
Peter Brougham (1778-1868).

and contemplate it fully and in all its bearings, we shall certainly come

matter of necessity. The most sensible give the decision up to him; so
that he is answerable to his own conscience, and to that alone.»&nbsp;
